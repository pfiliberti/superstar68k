These schematics were originally entered into ORCAD 3.11 ! I was able to
recover a drive with an old copy that ran in windows 98 using the vga640
driver. I plotted them all to postscript and converted to pdf. Almost
all of them are on a size paper however the video ram was a B size
sheet. 

File Descriptions:
superstar.pdf - The complete set but the video memory is truncated due to size.
vmem.pdf - The single video memory page by itself.
complete.pdf - The complete set with the video memory enlarged to fit.
