These are the designs for the PAL logic used on the board. The programs PAL20.EXE and PAL24.EXE are dos programs used to compile the pal design file into a .jed which can be burned into a device.

Possibly in a future design some of this logic can be removed if video features such as horizontal and vertical smoot scrolling are not desired. Or all the logic can be placed into a single larger device.
